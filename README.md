# market_indices_data
A Python script that I wrote to query historical data. Using it to backtest systematic trading strategies.

One can get the 10-year daily historical data of every stock that composes an index by simply specifying "SP500", "CAC40" or "FTSE100".

See the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) notebook for an example and data vizualisation on the French CAC40 index.
